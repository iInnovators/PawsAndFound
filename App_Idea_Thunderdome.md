# App Ideas Brainstorming
----------

 **App Idea 1: Paws and Found**
 
 **What:** Paws and Found is an app for pets who are lost. Lost pet owners will be able to share information and users can DM them in case they have spotted/found the lost pets.
 
 **Who:** The app is targeted for those who love and own animals looking for help or wanting to help others find their beloved pets.
 
**Why:** There are often many lost pet signs posted on lamps and trees which could fall off or not be noticed. An app dedicated to sharing those posts will help spread information faster.

 **Challenges:** Challenges that could be faced are users who fake finding an animal to take the reward money or spread misinformation. To prevent this, there should be a feature to verify new accounts.

 **Who:** The app is targeted for those interested in fashion and that struggle to pick what to wear for the week as well as those that have too much clothe to pick from.

 **Challenges:** Some of the challenges would be the algorithm for suggesting the outfits effectively. Another challenge would find a way to verify if the clothe sellers are real and potential would have to thoroughly verify the seller with a third party system.
