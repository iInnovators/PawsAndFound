## Overview

### Description

Paws and Found is an app for pets who are lost. Lost pet owners will be able to share information and users can DM them in case they have spotted/found the lost pets. The app is targeted for those who love and own animals looking for help or wanting to help others find their beloved pets. There are often many lost pet signs posted on lamps and trees which could fall off or not be noticed. An app dedicated to sharing those posts will help spread information faster.
